## 💡 About Me

I'm passionate about **Applied AI Research**, particularly at the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**. My goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge deep learning research and practical, impactful solutions. I love reading research papers, building models from scratch, and deploying intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.
